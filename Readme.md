The app for those who want to find the nearest foodtrucks in the San Fransico
Used stack: Flask + Postgres + Pure JS

Currently is in progress

The Front-end is ugly AF and can cause the eye bleeding as it was created with the only purpose to demonsrate the REST API of the backend.

Backend is not much better.

TODO:
1. Create a new client-side (probably, will be never done)
2. Add scripts for setting the database up
3. Add proper error handling
4. Replace hardcoded DB credentials to environment ones
5. Add the dynamic search radius and add meters support (current search radius is in radians)
6. (optionally) add users location
7. Add the marker for the point on the map, around which the search is processed (should be done at the client side which need to be made from scratch once again anyway, so, not a big deal)
8. Refactor the code
9. Add proper documentation/user guide
10. Add logging
11. Deploy it.... somewhere. Or mb better to delete this rep, burn the SSD and just try to move on. 


Thank you!
